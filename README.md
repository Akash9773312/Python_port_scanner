# Python_port_scanner

This is port scanner made with python programming languague which will let you know the open as well as closed ports available of a system or a web, one of the most important tool in the process of information gathering phase in ethical hacking.

I would not recommend you to use this port scanner tool on any web or system without having proper permission of the same.
